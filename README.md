# Parts API

A Django REST Framework API for managing parts and analyzing part descriptions.

## Features

- CRUD operations for parts (create, read, update, delete)
- Endpoint to find the 5 most common words in part descriptions
- Comprehensive test suite
- Containerization: Application is containerized using Docker for consistent deployments.


# Setup and Installation
##  Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/igormbq/django-api
   cd django-api
   ```

2. **Build and start the containers**
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

   This command will:
   - Build the Docker image
   - Start the Django application
   - Run database migrations automatically
   - Start the development server at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)

3. **How to execute the tests**:
```bash
docker compose run --rm web python manage.py test
```

## API Endpoints

### Parts CRUD Operations

- `GET /api/parts/` - List all parts
- `POST /api/parts/` - Create a new part
- `GET /api/parts/{id}/` - Retrieve a specific part
- `PUT /api/parts/{id}/` - Update a specific part
- `PATCH /api/parts/{id}/` - Partially update a specific part
- `DELETE /api/parts/{id}/` - Delete a specific part

### Common Words

- `GET /api/parts/common_words/` - Get the 5 most common words in part descriptions

## Project Structure Overview

- **api/**  
  Main Django project folder containing core settings and configuration:
  - `settings.py`: Main project settings.
  - `urls.py`: Root URL configuration.
  - `wsgi.py` & `asgi.py`: Entry points for WSGI/ASGI servers.

- **parts/**  
  Django app for your domain logic:
  - `models.py`: Database models.
  - `serializers.py`: DRF serializers for API data.
  - `views.py`: API and view logic.
  - `urls.py`: App-specific URL routes.
  - `tests.py`: Automated tests for this app.
  - `migrations/`: Database migration files.

- **manage.py**  
  Djangoâ€™s command-line utility for administrative tasks.

- **requirements.txt**  
  List of Python dependencies for the project.

- **Dockerfile**  
  Instructions to build the Docker image for this project.

  
## Design Decisions

1. **Django REST Framework**: Chosen for its robust features, excellent documentation, and adherence to REST principles.

2. **ModelViewSet**: Used to automatically provide all CRUD operations with minimal code, following DRY principles.

3. **Data Migration**: Created a migration to populate the database with initial data, ensuring consistency across environments.

4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Implemented tests for all API endpoints to ensure reliability.

5. **Common Words Algorithm**: Used Python's Counter class for efficient word counting, with preprocessing to clean text.

6. **API Structure**: Followed REST best practices with appropriate HTTP methods and status codes.
